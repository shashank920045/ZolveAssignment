Zolve BarChart Assignemnt

I have called 2 components from App Component - BarChart Component and CopyText Component.

BarChart uses chart2.js from which we can construct a Bar Chart. All we do is pass the data from App Component.
We also have a form which collects the data and fetches the data on submit. Then it is passed to BarChart Component.

CopyText Component uses URLSearch function to get the Url Params.
